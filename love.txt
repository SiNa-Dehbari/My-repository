Love rules. Love laughs. Love marches. Love
is the wolf that guards the gate.
Love is the food of music, art, poetry. It
fills us and fuels us and fires us to create.
Love is terror. Love is sweat. Love is bashed
pillow, crumpled shit, this is test!
this is now the second commit yaaaay!!!

love is the most secure feeling (sina Wien 2024)
